# Shodan.io-mobile-app
Unofficial repository for an updated Shodan.io mobile application. Only building for Android. 

The Android version can actually be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.shodan.app). 
The iOS version is not available anymore since Apple subscription was really expensive for such few users. 
However, the source code is now available so you can easily build the application and make it run on your iPhone/iPad. 

# How? 

This app has been built using the [ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) which is basically using [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) but also includes [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to build hybrid application (HTML5 + JavaScript basically).

# Contribution

Good news! The source code is now avaible.

* **Ionic-cli is required** before you start doing anything. 
* Go inside the ```code``` repository 
* ```ionic serve``` and this should install everything for you, run it locally and open up your fav browser with the app loaded in!
